            We realised that mainly recruitment process, particularly those
            involving agencies, tend to view interactions with both clients and
            candidates as means to their own self interested ends. GK Consulting
            hopes to change that narrative, by focusing on the critical and
            sensitive role it plays in collaborating with companies as they
            invest in the right people, and partnering with candidates as they
            progress their careers.

            Leveraging the founder`s industry experience and passion for talent,
            we are able to source excellent talent for clients and offer various
